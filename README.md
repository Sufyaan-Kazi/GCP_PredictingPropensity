# GCP_PredictingPropensity

This script uses BQML to create a simple ML model to predict a customers propensity to buy, using sample Google Analytics Data. The model is then deployed to AI Platform hub so it is available for online prediction.

This project is based on this tutorial: https://cloud.google.com/solutions/predicting-customer-propensity-to-buy. Create a new GCP project and then run this script in cloudshell
